# Contribution is fun! :green_heart:
From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new data structure or algorithm create an issue first. 

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Happy Contributing :slightly_smiling_face:

## Creating Issues
### Bug Reports 
A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

### New DS or Algo 
Any important new algortihm or Data Structure not already present in the list is welcome. 
Do create an issue first for the same and then make the PR.
